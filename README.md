# Radiative_capture_of_proton_at_low_enenrgy

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of atomic nuclei and their constituent particle.
Nuclear astro physics focuses on understanding the behaviour of nuclear matter and nuclear reaction within the stars.
Energy production in stars through p-p cycle.
CNO cycle is the Main source of energy in stars (>M☉).
Radiative capture in low energy refers to a nuclear reaction were a target nucleus captures a low energy particle (p,n) and then de-excites by emitting a gamma ray photon.

OBJECTIVE

In this work we cover radiative capture reactions in various astrophysical environments but specifically explode big bang nucleosynthesis and the neutron captures of S and R processes. The main aim of our work is to radiative capture of Proton through the 150(p,y) 14N reaction at low energy (20-110 MeV)

CONCLUSION

14N(p,γ)15O reaction determines the rate of the first CNO cycle and consequently influences the energy production and nucleosynthesis of a star.
Importance in understanding issues in Globular Clusters’ age determination, which depends strongly on the rate of this reaction and gives an upper limit to the age of the Universe. 
The cross section of the 14N(p,γ)15O reaction has to be determined with high precision with two nuclear model code calculation Talys 1.92 and EMPIRE 3.2.3.
Excitation function graph gives us the probability of production of radio isotope.
